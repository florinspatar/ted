Ted

[Building]

Currently to build Ted requires the following steps be followed:

 1. Install Apache Thrift, and Apache Ant for you platform.
 2. Enter the ted-api directory: $ cd ted-api
 3. Install ted-api to your local maven repo: $ mvn
 4. Change back to the main directory: $ cd ..
 5. Have Ant/Ivy pull down the dependencies: $ ant
 6. In Eclipse set a classpath variable TED_LIB_DIR to point
    to the newly created lib directory.
 7. Open projects in Eclipse.

[Lexicon]

Or what in the world I'm talking about.

 * ted-api:    The Thrift based API allowing clients in many languages
               to talk with the ted-server.
 * ted-server: The back-end daemon that looks for and downloads torrents.
 * ted-gui:    The UIs included in the Ted project.
 * gwt-ted:    The GWT UI to talk to the Ted-server.

In Ted there is a back-end domain model. This is the data that will be
persisted between restarts of the ted-server. When possible they will
use the simplest and shortest names for an item:

 * Series  
 * Episode

Data that is passed through the API may use longer names as not to
conflict with domain types.

 * WatchedSeries: A series of which you are currently interested in
                  tracking the episodes.
 * AiredEpisode:  An episode that has aired on a WatchedSeries while
                  it was a WatchedSeries. This does not include
                  episodes that may have aired before the Series became
                  a WatchedSeries (Unless manually added later).
